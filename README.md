Julia Westphal, Bianca Macias, Kang in Park, Chinedu Nnorom


An example flask rest API server, for SE Fall 2022.

To build production, type `make prod`.

To create the env for a new developer, run `make dev_env`.

## Overview
This app intends to improve upon the roommate-matching process that is currently implemented within NYU. 

There are a few basic questions that students are asked as they decide who they would be most compatible with as a roommate including time they go to sleep and wake up, how clean or messy they keep their space, and whether or not they're comfortable with guests, noise, etc. Having a roommate that fits in well with your lifestyle is super important, as they are someone you will be living with for almost an entire year. There is also a lot of anxiety when it comes to roommate matching as you never meet them (unless you connect with them prior by email) until move-in day. We propose a different, more interactive solution.

## Requirements
### The MVP of our app would include the following:

* Simple user log-in and profile creation
* Simple user quiz to begin roommate match process (by simple, we mean multiple choice answers and no type user input)

## Design
Each of the main requirements will correspond to an API endpoint.
